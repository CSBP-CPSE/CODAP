		<h1>How to Edit Buildings</h1>
		<p>1) To use the app you must first log into OpenStreetMap (OSM). Click on the "Login" button, which will open a new window to the OSM web site. You can then log into OSM on this new web page either through your OSM account or through various <a href='http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_account'>social media accounts </a></p>

		<p>3) Click on a <strong>single</strong> building footprint. A pop-up will appear from the menu at the bottom of the screen. This pop-up will provide you with some basic attribute information on the building. If you want to add or edit information regarding that building, click the edit button!</p>

		<p>4) A menu will slide up with a form to complete. Some items will already be filled out, which means this is the data that already exists on OSM. Fill out any incomplete information.
